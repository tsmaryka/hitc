 <p>The Laboratory of Integrative Lifespan Research&nbsp;conducts a program of many different kinds of research studies in health, cognition, and well-being. We are always looking for people to take part in&nbsp;our&nbsp;research studies. At the same time, we receive many offers from people who want to take part in research in order to help advance scientific knowledge about health, cognition, and well-being. In order to help this happen, we are developing a registry of people who have said they would like to be involved in our research.</p>\r                                                                        +
 <p>     The Volunteer Research Registry is designed to securely store your name, contact details and some basic information about you, such as&nbsp;the year in which you were born, and whether you have participated in any of our&nbsp;studies previously. In that way, we can contact you if a new research study is started in which you might be interested. Also, it allows us to avoid asking you for the same information each time you take part in a research study.</p>\r                                                                                                                                                       +
 <p>     If you decide to join the iLifespan&nbsp;Volunteer Research Registry, the Registry Administrator will periodically send you information about a research study for which you might be suitable - for you to decide if you would like to be involved. The decision is entirely yours. If you are interested in being involved, we will ask you to give us your consent to give your name and contact details to the iLifespan&nbsp;Researcher&nbsp;at the University of&nbsp;Victoria&nbsp;leading the specific research study. Your details will not be given to other Researchers, unless you specifically give your consent.</p>\r+
 <p>     We will securely store your details in the Volunteer Research Registry within a secure&nbsp;password-protected database. Only the Integrative Lifespan Volunteer Research Registry Administrator will have access to the database.</p>\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 <p>     Possible benefits of joining the Volunteer Research Registry include hearing about Integrative Lifespan Research studies when they first come on stream (that is, you wonâ€™t need to continually check the website for new research studies), and avoiding the need to supply the same information about yourself for each research study in which you take part. However, we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from a study.</p>\r                                                                                                                                                          +
