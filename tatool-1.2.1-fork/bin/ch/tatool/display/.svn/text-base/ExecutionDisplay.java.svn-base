 * An execution display provides a view for elements during execution.
 * 
 * The default implementation provides a Swing frame alongside different
 * helper classes to simplify element development.
 * 
 * Some modules might prefer implementing elements using a different view technology,
 * this aspect of modules has therefore been split out to cater for such wishes.
